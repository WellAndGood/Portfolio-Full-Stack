# Personal Portfolio

The following is a mock webpage of my (WellAndGood's) personal portfolio.
Last updated: June 14, 2021

This website is meant to demonstrate knowledge and competency in the following:

- The ability to follow a detailed user story,
- Building a webpage from scratch,
- Flexboxes,
- Media queries,
- Accessibility.

# Features

- Nav: Presents in a horizontal (left-right) format. When collapsed, it presents in a vertical (top-down) format.
- Body: set up in 3 rows of 2, formatted as a flexbox, which describe:
    - About Me (title and content)
    - Portfolio (title and content)
    - Contact information (title and content)
- Portfolio div: set up as a flexbox which arranges 5 clickable images.
- Contact div: features a nav which acts as a flexbox.
- Media queries: After the viewport reaches less than 992 and 768 pixels respectively, these act as breakpoints which re-arrange the divs (primarily as stacked columns instead of left-right orientation).
- **Note: The first two projects are actual projects, produced by the user (F34rTh3R34p3r). The last three projects serve as placeholders, which do not reflect of the user's abilities, and simply help to showcase the portfolio's flexbox.**
